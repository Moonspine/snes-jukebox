This folder contains third party utilities that are useful in SNES development.

bass - An assembler for the 6502 CPU geared toward production of SPC-700 machine code.
snesbrr - A utility to convert *.wav files into *.brr files for SNES consumption. Note that the SNES uses a 32 KHz sample rate, so some scaling may need to be done before using this utility.
Bin2Header - A utility which converts any binary file into a C++ header file. I (Moonspine) wrote this one, and it's not guaranteed to work on your system. It probably has dependencies on the .Net framework.
