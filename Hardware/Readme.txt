This folder contains a wealth of information regarding the hardware setup of the SNES Jukebox.
There are folders for each version of the project (the 1.0 Uno-based version and the 2.0 Mega-based version).
A little information on each piece of documentation:

1.0 (Uno)/Photos
 - Folder containing photographs of the finished device (version 1.0)
1.0 (Uno)/Schematic
 - A KiCad schematic of the version 1.0 device
 - WARNING: The schematic WAS NOT drawn when I built the device! I came back and reverse engineered it from my code and reference Arduino schematics, as well as by looking at the device itself. THIS IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE ACCURATE. Please double-check all wiring before powering anything on or committing to a design. I accept no responsibility for damaged components or non-functioning assemblies. Use at your own risk and double-check everything!
1.0 (Uno)/Jukebox Screen Support.stl
 - A 3D-printable support structure for the LCD screen module. It fits pretty tight though, so you may want to tweak it before use.

2.0 (Mega)/Photos
 - Folder containing photographs of the finished device (version 2.0)
2.0 (Mega)/Schematic
 - A KiCad schematic of the version 2.0 device
2.0 (Mega)/Parts List.txt
 - A parts list for the version 2.0 device if you'd like to try building it yourself. Note that this list may be incomplete, and links may be broken in the future.

Reference Images
 - Folder containing useful SNES reference images for your wiring convenience
APU Pinout.txt
 - The pinout of the SNES APU. Pro tip: The pin numbers are printed on the SNES motherboard. Pay attention when you remove it!
